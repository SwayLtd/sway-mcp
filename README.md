# Sway for AI assistants

[Sway](https://www.sway.events) is the events platform for electronic music and club culture. This
plugin connects an AI assistant to Sway's public catalogue: events, artists, venues, promoters and
genres.

- Read-only. It exposes public catalogue data only: no sign-in, no personal data, no drafts.
- Remote MCP server (streamable HTTP): `https://mcp.sway.events/api/mcp/discovery`
- Works with any client that supports Agent Plugins or remote MCP servers (Cursor, Grok Bot, Claude,
  ChatGPT and others).
